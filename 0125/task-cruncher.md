# Task & notes manager with voice support

06-Jan-25

I've tried out a few different tools for task and note management over the years and mostly feel like I never quite find what I'm looking for. I'll document here approximately what my version of a "dream tool" looks like at the moment. 

## Format-agnostic capture!

I've come to the conclusion that our insistence on dividing "things" into categories when it comes to productivity and workflow solutions actually might be counterproductive. Often the boundaries are blurry and these "things" are interconnected. Commonly, we might wish to jot down a note that will contain many tasks in it, or just one. Or sometimes we'll want to nest a note within a task. If we silo all of these tools into separate products, then we end up with the very familiar product of requiring a whole litany of solutions just to get through the work day.

I would like a tool that allowed for quick capture into an inbox and didn't require definition of the entity type. From this quick entry field, the user could capture a note, or jot down a calendar entry, or create a task, or narrate a series of tasks in a stream of consciousness type of text that might be captured using a speech to text tool. 

## AI inbox sorting

After aggregating all this material into one big inbox, I'd love a tool that leveraged AI in order to try to do some initial triage and sorting. This would require natural language processing to identify the usual constituent elements of tasks, but would also require some kind of mechanism to distinguish between the various types of entities we commonly reference, such as tasks, calendar entries, and notes. Perhaps this tool would be a stand alone digital assistant that is interconnected with the siloed tools. IE, it would create calendar entries in calendar, tasks in Todoist, etc. But I think it would be more transformative to have a single online workspace that was front ended as such by this assistant. 

## Web UI & Android

My preferences for supported platforms are always web UI and Android. I use Open SUSE Linux and have used a number of different distros over the years and rather than finding tools that support a specific destroy. I generally find it more helpful to find ones with a reliable web UI as just about anything can be converted easily into a PWA that should work easily across all distros 

## Seamless voice integration

It's oddly difficult, even in 2025, to find tools that really do speech to text well, integrating it natively into the product. 

From using speech to text all day for a couple of months. If I'm qualified to have an early opinion on the state of technology, it's that Open AI Whisper and ASR is vastly better than many of the competitive tools, including the built in speech to text transcription that comes in Chrome. I would go so far as to say the qualitative leader almost different solutions. Seamless integration for STT and TTS is a big advantage for me. Keyboard shortcuts are extremely useful too, because they allow users to use voice input in combination with supporting hardware like USB pedals.
